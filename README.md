The Learning Management System (LMS) is a web-based application designed to facilitate the management of educational courses, student enrollment, and progress tracking. This system consist three modules - Admin, Instructor and Student.  It provides a platform for students and instructors to interact, manage course materials, and assess student performance. The Instructor will create course on this platform and any student can purchase the course using credentials.
